# Learning Rust 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning the Rust programming language. Rust is known for its performance, safety, and concurrency, and I’m excited to explore its features and capabilities!

## Current Progress 📚

I have completed the following topics so far:
- Variables
- Functions
- Data Types

## Why Rust? 🤔

Rust is a systems programming language that provides:
- **Memory Safety**: With a strict ownership model, Rust prevents null pointer dereferences and data races.
- **High Performance**: Comparable to C/C++, Rust offers low-level control without sacrificing safety.
- **Concurrency**: Rust’s fearless concurrency model makes multi-threading safe and efficient.

## Goals 🎯

- Deepen my understanding of Rust concepts like ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and error handling.
- Build practical projects to apply what I’ve learned.
- Share my knowledge and progress through this repository.
